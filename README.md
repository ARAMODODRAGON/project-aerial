# Project Aerial
 
Project Aerial is a Touhou inspired bullet hell shooter made in monogame. 

The solution consists of two projects:

- Aerial
  - The game specific classes such as the player and levels
- Astronaut
  - The non specific classes that handle the bullets and entities and loading/unloading levels
