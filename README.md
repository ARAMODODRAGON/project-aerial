# Project Aerial

Ok so again I decided to make a new project to work on this game. I decided that writing my own collision engine was just too much work for me and not what I wanted to focus on. New project will be [here](https://github.com/ARAMODODRAGON/Aerial/tree/master) and this project will be archived.

Project Aerial is a Touhou inspired bullet hell shooter made in monogame. 

The solution consists of two projects:

- Aerial
  - The game specific classes such as the player and levels
- Astronaut
  - The non specific classes that handle the bullets and entities and loading/unloading levels
